# Connect Four Project :red_circle:

> This Iron Yard project was to build the classic game Connect Four using JavaScript and React. with the following required features:

- Built using React
- Use only functional, stateless components. Components should only render based on their `props`. Components should not have any `state`.
- There should be "one source of truth" for the game's state. ie: one state object
- You should be able to start a game, play to completion, and then begin a new game, etc. ie: it never "stops"
- The application should detect when a game has been won or ends in a draw.
- The game should work well on a mobile device. Imagine two friends passing a phone back and forth while waiting in line for a concert or similar.
